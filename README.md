# Experiment Analysis: Conservation of Mechanical Energy

## Overview

In this experiment, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to understand the relationship between the kinematic variables of a body in motion within a specified region. Utilizing a low-friction inclined track and a cart, various data points were measured, including the time it takes for the cart to travel from an initial position (Xo, Yo) to a final position (Xf, Yf). These measurements were crucial in evaluating the adherence to the Law of Conservation of Mechanical Energy for a simple mechanical system.

The experiment involved exploring the kinetic and potential energy of the cart on a five-degree inclined track, providing insights into the conservation of mechanical energy (E=K+U) in the system.
